    <h2><center>Chinese cuisine</center></h2>
    <p>
      Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes
      cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from
      Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese
      diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has
      influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater
      to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles,
      tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be
      found worldwide.

      Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittsə]) is a savory dish of
      Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened
      wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
      ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple,
      meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
      wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person
      who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
